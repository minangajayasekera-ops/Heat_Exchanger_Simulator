# Heat Exchanger Simulation

A Python GUI application to simulate and visualise counter-current and co-current heat exchangers. This tool allows users to explore how hot and cold fluid streams exchange heat along a heat exchanger and see the results in temperature profiles and pipe schematics.

## Features

- Counter-current and co-current configurations
- Input parameters for:
  - Hot/cold inlet temperatures
  - Mass flow rates
  - Heat capacities
  - Overall heat transfer coefficient
  - Heat exchanger area and length
- Real-time visualisation:
  - Temperature vs. position plot
  - Colored pipe schematic representing hot and cold streams
  - Calculates the outlet temperatures of both streams
- Interactive Tkinter GUI to update parameters
