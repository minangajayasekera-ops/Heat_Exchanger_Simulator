# Heat Exchanger Simulation

A Python GUI application to simulate and visualize **counter-current and co-current heat exchangers**. This tool allows users to explore how **hot and cold fluid streams exchange heat** along a heat exchanger and see the results in **temperature profiles** and **pipe schematics**.

## Features

- **Counter-current and co-current configurations**
- Input parameters for:
  - Hot/cold inlet temperatures
  - Mass flow rates
  - Heat capacities
  - Overall heat transfer coefficient
  - Heat exchanger area and length
- Real-time visualization:
  - Temperature vs. position plot
  - Colored pipe schematic representing hot and cold streams
  - Horizontal colorbar indicating temperature
- Interactive **Tkinter GUI** to update parameters dynamically
